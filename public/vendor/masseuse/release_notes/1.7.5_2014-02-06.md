* The start method now runs its life cycle methods synchronously if all defined methods are synchronous.
    * This allows certain simplifications, for example:

        ```javascript
        synchronousView.start()
            .done(function() {
                doSomethingThatReliesOnTheViewBeingStarted();
            });
        ```

    * can now optionally be simplified to synchronous code:

        ```javascript
        synchronousView.start();
        doSomethingThatReliesOnTheViewBeingStarted();
        ```

    * but any code that was listening for progress on a synchronous view has to be modified to use the built in events:

        ```javascript
        # cannot notify on promises that are resolved, so the following has to be changed:
        synchView.start().progress(function(event) { if ("..." === event) ...

        # to:
        synchView.on("...", ...);
        synchView.start();
        ```
