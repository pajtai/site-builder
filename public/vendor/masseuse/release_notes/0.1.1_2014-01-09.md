    * ensuring that masseuse view configs can pass view specific formatters and binders

The default binders and formatters and always added on. Each view can now take arrays of binders and formatters.
These are `_.extend`ed into each other.

Usage:

```javascript
var viewOptions = {
    // ...
    rivetFormatters : [homeFormatters],
    rivetBinders : [projectBinders, specificBinders]
    // ...
}
```
