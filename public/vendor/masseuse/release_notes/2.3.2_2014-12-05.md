    * Adding the ability to pass additional bindings to the rivets view.

    This makes it possible to include objects into your rivet views that you do not necessarily want to put into your viewModels.

    For example, if you wanted a resources or localization file available in your view, but you dont want to put that file in your model, you could do:

        In your view config, add a rivetsConfig object with a bindings property. Any objects, strings etc you attach here will be available as root level bindings in the DOM:
        ```javascript
        rivetsConfig : {
            bindings : {
                resources : {
                    someString : 'THIS STRING IS SUPER RAD!'
                }
            }
        }
        ```

        In the DOM:
        ```html
        <div>{{ resources.someString }}</div>
        ```
