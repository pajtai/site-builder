* Features
    * `view.addChildren()` can be used to add multiple children as arguments or an array.
    * `options.ViewType` will dictate the type of view created.
        * This is useful for View factories and especially for the addtion of children using an `options` object.
* Patches
    * The `afterRender` method on a View is now only called after all children are done rendering.
    * For a child view `appendTo` functions within the context of the parent

        ```javascript
        parentView.addChildren({
            // The child view's el will be appended to parentView.$el.find('ul') aka: parentView.$('ul')
            appendTo:'ul'
        });
        ```
