* patches
    * the child view binder - `data-rv-new-...` now uses the element with the `data-rv-new-...` attribute as its `el`.
    * this gets rid of some unnecessary nesting in certain cases where the child view produces multiple elements
    * previously code such as below was not possible, since appended elements can only have one root level element

        ```javascript
        // Parent template.html
        <ul data-rv-new-list="view.childListModel"></ul>

        // Child template.html
        <li data-rv-each-listItem="model:list" data-rv-text="listItem"></li>
        ```
