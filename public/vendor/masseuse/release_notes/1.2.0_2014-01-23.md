* Masseuse now supports Backbone collections.
    * In rivets, you now have access to a collection on the view. Attach the collection to `view.collection` and then it will be available in rivets as `collection:`.

        ```html
        <ul data-rv-each-movie="collection:">
            <li data-rv-text="movie:title"></li>
        </ul>
        ```

    * the scope of the iterated is each model in the collection. This is equivalent to `colleciton.models`.
    * Important to note the trailing colon on the iterable and the colon used to access model properties in the iteration.
