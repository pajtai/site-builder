* Calling render on a view will now call render on any started children
* plugins is now included on masseuse
    * to upgrade remove the rivetsPlugin package and instead use:

        ```javascript
        RivetsView = masseuse.plugins.rivets.RivetsView
        ```

    * this change was needed to make `intanceof` for ViewContext, Channels and other modules used by both masseuse and the plugins work as expected.
