* BaseViews now have a `.refresh()` method.
    * `refresh()` removes the view and all its children and calls start on it again.
    * `refresh()` returns the start promise.
    * `refreshChildren()` calls refresh on each child.
    * `refresh()` and `refreshChildren()` are often useful if start triggers a server data fetch in - for example - `beforeRender()`.
* `ProxyProperty` in `options.modelData` can now use `ViewContext`

    ```javascript
    // This is a view where view.depthData is a model
    var view = new CustomView({
        modelData : {
            depth : ProxyProperty('mark', ViewContext('depthData'))
        }
    });
    ```
