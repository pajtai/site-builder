* replacing `|` characters in release notes md files with `_`, since `|` is not allowed in file names for Windows
* `grunt notes:since:1.0.0` will no longer show the notes for `1.0.0`, only the release notes after `1.0.0`
    * note that grunt tasks must be run from the massesue dir and npm install has to be run previously from that dir
