    * A constructor can be passed and array of options, and those will get extended into each other. The outcome will be a clone, and the passed in values are not modified.
    * `options` are now deep extended. For example if `defaultOptions` has `modelData`, then it will be extended with the `options.modelData` of the options a view is newed.
* `channels` is now available on `masseusse.utilities.channels`
