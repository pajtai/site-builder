* in rivets `model` is available instead of `data`
* default rivets `.` adapter is available for POJSOs
* `:` is available for Backbone Models
    * `->` is used for nested fields in data
* to update replace the following
    * replace `data.` with `model:`
    * replace all dots in references that begin with `model:` with `->`
    * dots in references that do not begin with `model:` should be left as is
* `options.templateHtml` is now `options.template`
* `options.el` can no longer be used to indicate the view to be appended to
    * the `options.appendView` flag is removed
    * instead `options.appendTo` can be used to define the element to append to
        * `options.appendTo` may either be a sizzle selector, DOM element, or jQuery object
    * the `options.el` wrapper div is now created as expected with optional usage of `id`, `className`, `tagName`, `attributes`
        * this resets masseuse to use base Backbone functionality around el
    * if `options.wrapper` === false, and `appendTo` is truthy, then no wrapping div will be supplied
* deeply nested models are listened to and so can be riveted nicely using the arrow notation
    * for example:

        ```javascript
        model.set({this:{that:{other:nestedModel}}});
        // will trigger model change event:
        nestedModel.set('blah.blah.blah','blah');
        // will trigger model change event:
        model.set('this.that.other.blah.blah.blah','ha');
        ```

    * the above can be riveted with

        ```html
        <div>{{model:this->that->other->blah->blah->blah}}</div>
        ```
* a field on views called `defaultOptions` is available
    * intialize will use clones to `_.extend(defaultOptionsClone, optionsClone)` to create the options used for the view
    * this can slim down the define blocks of view factories
    * if `options` has keys that have a value of undefined, these undefined will shadow the values on `defaultOptions`
